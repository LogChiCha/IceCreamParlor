# IceCreamParlor
The program should create a simulation of an ice cream parlor.
     * The user must respond to customers with randomized orders of 4 flavours.
     * The user may then add flavours in the correct order to a cone on screen, and hit a "Serve" button to give it to the customer.
     * If the order was correct, it will increase a "Correct Orders" counter, otherwise it will not.
     * It should inform the player if they did the order correctly
     * There is also a "Scrap" button that allows the order to be reset.

Made as Year 1, Sem 2 Project for CPS209.
